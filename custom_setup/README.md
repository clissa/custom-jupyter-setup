Setup
=========
Sets up the Jupyter notebook with a template of markdown, adds user-defined default imports,
and prompts users to rename the notebook if it's currently called "Untitled".
Edit the template or default imports in `main.js`

This extension is built on top of [](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/Data-Analysis/tree/master/setup) and adapted for personal use. Feel free to edit according to your personal preferences and needs :)
